Input: nums = [3,2,4,4,1], costs = [3,7,6,4,2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You start at index 0.
- Jump to index 2 with a cost of costs[2] = 6.
- Jump to index 4 with a cost of costs[4] = 2.
The total cost is 8. It can be proven that 8 is the minimum cost needed.
Two other possible paths are from index 0 -> 1 -> 4 and index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.
These have a total cost of 9 and 12, respectively.
