Input: nums = [3,4,5,5,3,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Perform the following swaps:
- Swap 1: Swap the 3rd and 4th elements, nums is then [3,4,5,3,5,1].
- Swap 2: Swap the 4th and 5th elements, nums is then [3,4,5,3,1,5].
- Swap 3: Swap the 3rd and 4th elements, nums is then [3,4,5,1,3,5].
- Swap 4: Swap the 2nd and 3rd elements, nums is then [3,4,1,5,3,5].
- Swap 5: Swap the 1st and 2nd elements, nums is then [3,1,4,5,3,5].
- Swap 6: Swap the 0th and 1st elements, nums is then [1,3,4,5,3,5].
It can be shown that 6 swaps is the minimum swaps required to make a valid array.
