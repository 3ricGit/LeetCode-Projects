Input: nums = [4,3,2,1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can turn the array into a palindrome in 2 operations as follows:
- Apply the operation on the fourth and fifth element of the array, nums becomes equal to [4,3,2,3,3,1].
- Apply the operation on the fifth and sixth element of the array, nums becomes equal to [4,3,2,3,4].
The array [4,3,2,3,4] is a palindrome.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed.
