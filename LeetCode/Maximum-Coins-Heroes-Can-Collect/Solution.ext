Input: heroes = [1,4,2], monsters = [1,1,5,2,3], coins = [2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [5,16,10]
Explanation: For each hero, we list the index of all the monsters he can defeat:
1st hero: [1,2] since the power of this hero is 1 and monsters[1], monsters[2] <= 1. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] = 5 coins.
2nd hero: [1,2,4,5] since the power of this hero is 4 and monsters[1], monsters[2], monsters[4], monsters[5] <= 4. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[4] + coins[5] = 16 coins.
3rd hero: [1,2,4] since the power of this hero is 2 and monsters[1], monsters[2], monsters[4] <= 2. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[4] = 10 coins.
So the answer would be [5,16,10].
